This project is a C++ code to prepare a report card for students. It takes the data from the user, 
stores it in a binary file called “studt.dat”, and gives the option to the user of reading the data from the file, as 
well as modify the data.
The header files used in the program are iostream.h, conio.h, stdio.h, fstream.h, iomanip.h, and process.h.
The functions used in the program are
Calculate()- to assign a char value  to variable grade
Getdata()- takes the values from the user
Showdata()- outputs the values entered from the user
Retrollno()- returns the value of rollno
Write_student()- writes the data into studt.dat file
Display_all()- reads and shows data from studt.dat file
Display_sp(int)- reads and shows specific record from file
Modify_student()- modifies the specific record after taking the roll no from user
Entry_menu()- entry/edit menu function

The program works satisfactorily to generate a report card for a student and manipulate it. However it could be improved 
in several ways, with more features being added to the existing code. Unfortunately, those features and the requisite 
coding are not a part of our syllabus.  Features that I would like to add would include hosting the program on a server, 
so that all the computers in school can access it. It can also be put on a website, so that parents and students can 
also look at the reports.
